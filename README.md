## Setup

Our work is built on the codebase of the original 3D Gaussian Splatting method. Please refer to the [original 3D Gaussian Splatting repository](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) for details about requirements.

## Pre-processing

### Data preparation

The first step is to generate the multi-resolution data for the training part. In our paper, we downsample the original data by factors of 2×, 4×, and 8×, to have four levels of resolution. 

We provide a script to generate multi-resolution data for four datasets we used in the paper: Synthetic Blender (*nerf_synthetic*), Mip-NeRF360 (*360*), Tanks&Temples (*tandt*), and Deep Blending (*db*). You can run the script with the following command:
```bash
python dataset_prepare.py --source_base <path to the source dataset root directory> --dataset_name <name of the dataset> --output_base <path to the output dataset root directory>
```

Note that that similar to MipNeRF360 and original 3DGS, we target images at resolutions in the 1-1.6K pixel range. Therefore, for the *360* dataset, images whose width exceeds 1600 pixels will be automatically resized to 1600 pixels.

### Dataset structure

For example, we can generate the dataset hierarchy of dataset *db* with the following command:
```bash
python dataset_prepare.py --source_base ./raw_dataset --dataset_name db --output_base ./source
```

You should have the following file structure for the model training:
```
project
└── raw_dataset # source_base
    ├── db # dataset_name
    │   └── playroom # scene
    │       ├── sparse
    │       └── images
└── source # output_base
    ├── db # dataset_name
    │   └── playroom # scene
    │       └── playroom_res1
    │           ├── sparse
    │           └── images
    │       └── playroom_res2
    │           ├── sparse
    │           └── images
    │       └── playroom_res4
    │           ├── sparse
    │           └── images
    │       └── playroom_res8
    │           ├── sparse
    │           └── images
```

As for NeRF Synthetic dataset, the structure is as follows:
```
project
└── source
    ├── nerf_synthetic
    │   └── lego
    │       └── lego_res1
    │           ├── train
    │           ├── test
    │           ├── transforms_test.json
    │           └── transforms_train.json
    │       └── lego_res2
    │           ├── train
    │           ├── test
    │           ├── transforms_test.json
    │           └── transforms_train.json
    │       └── lego_res4
    │           ├── train
    │           ├── test
    │           ├── transforms_test.json
    │           └── transforms_train.json
    │       └── lego_res8
    │           ├── train
    │           ├── test
    │           ├── transforms_test.json
    │           └── transforms_train.json
```


## Running


```bash
python train_full_pipeline.py --model_base <path to the output model root directory> --dataset_base <path to the source root directory> --dataset_name <name of the dataset> --scene <name of the scene> --method <name of the method>
```

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Please click here to see the arguments for the `train_full_pipeline.py` script.</span></summary>

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-------: | :--: | :---------: |
| `--model_base`   | `str` | Path to the output model root directory.|
| `--dataset_base` | `str` | Path to the source root directory. |
| `--dataset_name` | `str` | Name of the dataset of scenes. |
| `--scene`        | `str` | Name of the scene. |
| `--method`       | `str` | Name of the method we build the LOD 3DGS. Can be `"lapis"` (the proposed method) and `"freeze"` (freeze all attributes of the previous layer(s) when train the current layer). |

</details>
<br>

For example, we train the model for the scene *playroom* from dataset *db* with the proposed method *lapis*, using the command:
```bash
python train_full_pipeline.py --model_base ./model --dataset_base ./source --dataset_name db --scene playroom --method lapis
```

The file structure after training should be as follows:
```
project
└── source # dataset_base
    ├── db # dataset_name
    │   └── playroom # scene
    │       ├── playroom_res1
    │       ├── playroom_res2
    │       ├── playroom_res4
    │       └── playroom_res8
└── model # model_base
    ├── db # dataset_name
    │   └── playroom # scene
    │       └── lapis # method
    │           ├── playroom_res1
    │           ├── playroom_res2
    │           ├── playroom_res4
    │           └── playroom_res8
```

### How to extract the enhanced layer

Note that \<scene\>_res1 is the highest resolution, and \<scene\>_res8 is the lowest resolution. The model is trained from the lowest resolution to the highest resolution. The model stored in the higher resolution folder contains not only the higher layer but also the lower layer(s).

We construct the merged GS with a specially designed order: the lower layers come first as the foundation base, and the enhanced layer is stiched behind the foundation base, as shown in the figure below. As the foundation base is frozen to optimization and adaptive control, one can easily extract the enhanced layer by performing the operation like GS[size_of_foundation_layers:].

### CUDA out-of-memory error

Through experiments, we found that the default loss function is not sensitive to low-resolution images, making optimization and desification failed. It is because in the default loss function, L1 loss is attached much more importance (0.8), but L1 loss is not sensitive to finer details, blurriness, or low-resolution artifacts. Therefore, the loss, computed from the default loss function, would be small at low layers, disabling the parameter update and adaptive control for the low-layer Gaussian splats. Therefore, we set lambda_dssim to 0.8 to emphasize the structural similarity loss, which is more sensitive to low-resolution artifacts and then causes much heavier desification, finally producing bigger 3DGS model. 

To reduce the model size, you may try to 1) lower down the lambda_dssim, or 2) increase the densification threshold. Also, generally speaking, it is not necessary to make it SSIM-sensitive for complex scenes. For example, we note that training LapisGS for complex scene *playroom* with default lambda_dssim 0.2 can still produce reasonable layered structure, while it fails for simple object *lego*.



## Evaluation

We use the following command to evaluate the model:
```bash
python render.py -m <path to trained model> # Generate renderings
python metrics.py -m <path to trained model> # Compute error metrics on renderings
```

Based on our LapisGS, we built the first ever dynamic 3DGS streaming system, which achieves superior performance in both live streaming and on-demand streaming.
